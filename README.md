# coinmarketcap_scarper

What does a scarper do?

First of all, it collects data about coins, such as: name, symbol, price, capitalization.
Also scarper downloads the image of each coin to a separate folder, if you don't need it, just delete the part of the code labeled # Image download. 
To start working with the code, you need to get access to the api, you can do this by clicking on the link and registering: https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/login/.
